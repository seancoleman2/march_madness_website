			<p class="description">To test our model, we tuned the parameters on every year we had data for up to 2014 and then tested on the tournament results from the 2015 and 2016 seasons. 
			</p>

			<p class="description">
			For the 2015 season our model scored 960 points with a single bracket. That score puts us in the 75th percentile of all brackets nationally. When we tested our ensemble method (creates and tests 10 unique brackets using a range of high-variance strategies), our highest score was 980, putting us in the 76th percentile. Our bracket picks are below, games highlighted in green are games we predicted correctly, games highlighted in red are games we did not predict correctly.

		    <p class="description">For the 2016 season our model scored 1000 points with a single bracket. That score puts in the 95th percentile of all brackets nationally. With the ensemble method, we scored 1260 points which puts us in the 99.2 percentile for 2016. This is our 2016 bracket.</p>
